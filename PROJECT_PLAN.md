# E-Commerce Platform - Project Plan

## Project Overview
A production-ready e-commerce backend built with Go, featuring microservices architecture, event-driven communication, and comprehensive observability.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Go 1.21+
- **Communication**: gRPC, GraphQL Gateway
- **Message Brokers**: 
  - Apache Kafka (event streaming, analytics)
  - RabbitMQ (task queuing, reliable messaging)
- **Databases**: 
  - PostgreSQL (primary transactional database)
  - Redis (caching, session storage, rate limiting)
  - Elasticsearch (search and analytics)
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **Security**: Vault for secrets, JWT authentication, TLS/mTLS

## Architecture Overview

### Microservices
1. **API Gateway** (GraphQL endpoint)
2. **User Service** (authentication, profiles)
3. **Product Service** (catalog management)
4. **Order Service** (order processing)
5. **Payment Service** (payment processing)
6. **Inventory Service** (stock management)
7. **Notification Service** (email/SMS notifications)

## Database Architecture & Data Flow

### Primary Databases
1. **PostgreSQL** - ACID-compliant transactional database
   - User accounts and profiles
   - Product catalog
   - Order management
   - Payment records
   - Inventory tracking

2. **Redis** - In-memory data store
   - Session management and JWT blacklisting
   - API rate limiting counters
   - Product catalog caching
   - Cart data (temporary)
   - Real-time inventory counts
   - Pub/Sub for real-time notifications

3. **Elasticsearch** - Search and analytics
   - Product search with full-text capabilities
   - Order history search
   - Analytics and reporting
   - Log aggregation (part of ELK stack)

### Kafka as Event Stream (Not Database Queue)
Kafka serves as an **event streaming platform**, not a database queue:
- **Event Sourcing**: Store domain events for audit trails
- **Inter-service Communication**: Async messaging between microservices
- **Real-time Data Pipeline**: Stream processing for analytics
- **Event-driven Architecture**: Decoupled service communication

**Why Kafka isn't used as a database queue:**
- Kafka is designed for high-throughput event streaming, not transactional queries
- No ACID properties needed for traditional database operations
- PostgreSQL provides better consistency for transactional data
- Kafka complements databases by providing event-driven communication

### Data Flow Pattern
```
Client Request → GraphQL Gateway → Service (PostgreSQL) → Events/Tasks
                                      ↓
                               Redis Cache Update
                                      ↓
Events: Kafka (analytics, audit logs)
Tasks: RabbitMQ (email, payment processing, notifications)
```

### Communication Patterns
- **Synchronous**: gRPC for inter-service communication
- **Event Streaming**: Kafka for analytics and event sourcing
