## Architecture

- **7 Microservices**: API Gateway, User, Product, Order, Payment, Inventory, Notification
- **Communication**: gRPC (sync), Kafka (events), RabbitMQ (tasks), GraphQL (client)
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch
- **Observability**: ELK Stack, Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger
- **Security**: Vault, JWT, TLS/mTLS, RBAC

## üöÄ Quick Start for Development

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21 or later
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone and Setup**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository>
   cd ecommerce-platform
   make dev-setup
   ```

2. **Start User Service**
   ```bash
   make run-user-service
   ```
   This automatically starts PostgreSQL, Redis, Jaeger, and Prometheus, then runs the User Service.

3. **Test the API**
   ```bash
   # Register a user
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/register \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"username":"testuser","email":"test@example.com","password":"Password123!"}'

   # Login
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"username":"testuser","password":"Password123!"}'
   ```

### Development Infrastructure

The development environment uses Docker Compose to provide:

| Service | URL | Purpose |
|---------|-----|---------|
| PostgreSQL | `localhost:5432` | Primary database (dev + test DBs) |
| Redis | `localhost:6379` | Caching and session storage |
| Jaeger | `http://localhost:16686` | Distributed tracing UI |
| Prometheus | `http://localhost:9090` | Metrics collection |

**Database Configuration:**
- **Development DB**: `commercium_db` 
- **Test DB**: `commercium_test_db` (automatically created)
- **User**: `commercium_user`
- **Password**: `commercium_password`

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Start only databases for lightweight development
make dev-db-up

# Run integration tests (automatically starts required services)
make test-integration

# Full development environment
make dev-up

# View logs
make dev-db-logs

# Clean shutdown
make dev-down
```

### Testing Approach

The project uses a **multi-tier testing strategy**:

1. **Unit Tests**: Fast tests with no external dependencies
   ```bash
   make test-unit
   ```

2. **Integration Tests**: Full API testing with real database
   ```bash
   make test-integration  # Automatically starts dev database
   ```

3. **Local Service Testing**: Run services against real infrastructure
   ```bash
   make run-user-service  # Starts service with PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.
   ```

**Test Database Strategy:**
- Integration tests use `commercium_test_db` (separate from development data)
- Tests automatically skip if infrastructure is unavailable (CI-friendly)
- Database is reset between test runs for consistency

### Configuration Management

The project supports environment-specific configurations:

- `configs/config.yaml` - Basic development config
- `configs/config-full.yaml` - Complete config with all services
- Docker Compose automatically configures service connectivity

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
CONFIG_PATH=configs/config-full.yaml  # Override config file
```

```

### 2. Proto Generation
```bash
make proto-gen     # Generate gRPC code from proto files
```

### 3. Database Migrations

make migrate-up    # Apply migrations
make migrate-down  # Rollback migrations
```

### 4. Load Testing
```bash
make load-test     # Run k6 load tests
```
