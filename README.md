## Architecture

- **7 Microservices**: API Gateway, User, Product, Order, Payment, Inventory, Notification
- **Communication**: gRPC (sync), Kafka (events), RabbitMQ (tasks), GraphQL (client)
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch
- **Observability**: ELK Stack, Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger
- **Security**: Vault, JWT, TLS/mTLS, RBAC

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- kubectl (for Kubernetes deployment)

### Local Development

1. **Clone and setup**:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ecommerce-platform
make setup-dev
```

2. **Start infrastructure**:
```bash
docker-compose up -d postgres redis kafka rabbitmq elasticsearch
```

3. **Run services**:
```bash
make run-all
```

4. **Access services**:
- GraphQL Playground: http://localhost:8080/playground
- Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
- Grafana: http://localhost:3000
- Kibana: http://localhost:5601
